# Eye Tracking

This simple but very useful app can be useful for your own eye tracking projects.

## Features
1. **Simplicity:** Easy-to-use interface with minimal input required.
2. **Speed:** I think that this app will work good enough on literally any PC.

## How to use

Try to keep your eye (only one) as closer as you can to your web camera.

## To-Do
- [] **Add some useful things in it:** Hm, maybe we can create a function to take screenshots with eyes?
- [] **Enhance Settings and Templates:** Introduce more customizable settings and templates for better user experience.
